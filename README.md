# Armor HUD
A simple Minecraft Fabric mod that adds a HUD to display the current armor & elytra you are wearing and its durability.

I made this to replace the functionality of the [BerdinskiyBear's Armor HUD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/berdinskiybears-armor-hud) mod from Forge, which I like, but it doesn't get updated.
